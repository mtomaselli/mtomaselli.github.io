								<h2 class="major">Interests in IT</h2
									
							<p> My interest in I.T began when i was around 5. It was my birthday and my parents had just bought me a playstation 2 which at the time was the pinnacle of gamimg performance. My first ever console, i plugged it in and was instantly blown away with what i could do with it, how by pressing certain buttons performed specific actions. I remember thinking in my childlike mind that it was like watching a movie, except i was in direct in control of how the story played out, this was the exact moment i became obsessed with technology. Than the game boy came out and now i could take my experiences on the go, followed by the Nintendo DS which included touch features which made me feel closer with the game, than the Wii which added gestures and movements so you were now physically playing the game, i than bought an xbox 360 which was my first oonline gaming experience so not only could i play on my own but with my friends and anyone in the world. When i think about it gaming introduced me to technology that i didnt think was possible, but what i really fell in love with was the rapid advancements in technology. That is my main interest in I.T, i want to be part of the next breakthrough, the next advancements, in my short life i have seen the world go from using small, compact, button heavy phones to phones with no buttons that you can open with your face.  I am a firm believer that technology is the future and if we can achieve so much progress in only 20 years, who knows what the future holds.</p>
							<p> My main experience with I.T is being the go to guy when something stops working either at work or at home. Im also curious about how things work so i taught myself how to take apart and iphone and change the components such as batteries, screens, digitizers etc. doing this i became an asset to clumsy friends and family who had damaged their phones. I enjoy learning and understanding how things work and using that knowledge to help others so thats a very big interst of mine.</p>
								
							<p> Originally i never even thought about coming to RMIT. In high school i loved the law and business side of things and didn't even do any I.T related subjects as i didnt want my hobby to become my chore. After graduating, having enjoyed law and busness i naturally enrolled into a law and commerce double degree. I went to Latrobe for this both because i had heard good things and it was one of the only universities offering a double degree like this one. initially i enjoyed the course however over time i became less motivated in my studies. i thought this was because i had burnt myself out too quickly so after semester 1 i went on a holiday and back in semester 2 ready to go. However i realised that my motivation decrease wasnt caused by working too hard, but because i was not passionate about what i was doing. Upon this realisation i left latrobe in 2018 and applied for RMIT for an I.T degree, orignally not getting in at the start of the year but succeeding in the mid year intake. It wasn't a hard choice, what better place to study information technology than the royal melbourne institution of technology!. The course appealed to me because there were so many electives to choose from and having discovered recently that security in I.T is something that interests me,  i look forward to these electives. I like the campus at Rmit as well as its reupation for being "industry focused" to prepare students for the real world and so here i am today.</p>
								
							<p> During my studies i expect to learn a myriad of things. I hope to learn the ins and outs of everything information technology and expand on my own knowledge. whether it be hardware, software, programming, web design, various coding languages if it is related to I.T i want to know it. I also hope to learn new vital skills and improve upon my own existing skills that will become the foundation of a hopefully successful career. I.T is such a broad field that i hope through my time at RMIT that i discover an area that i could see myself in every day and enjoying. I expect to learn abilities that make me more employable upon graduation so that i stand out against the hordes of universitiy graduates out there. Most of all i expect to feel that feeling of amazement when learning something new for the first time and i am confident i can experience that here. </p>

								  <h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>
								
								 <p> I am a 20 year old student studying a bachelor of information technology at RMIT university. I live in the northern suburbs of Melbourn with my family which includes my parents, older sister and younger brother. I come from an italian background and can speak small amounts of italian. I love to travel and am planning to return to europe in the near future. I studied at St Monicas College in Epping where i completed my VCE. I was accepted into Latrobe University and studied Law/commerce for a year but than decided it wasnt for me. I worked full time and still part time as a Bar-tender for a local restaurant. After taking some time to think about what i wanted to do i realised that i've always loved technology and have been around it ever since i was a kid and so i applied to Rmit. My main hobbies are working on my car and playing videogames with my brother as it has been a valued past time of mine since i was old enough to hold a controller.</p>

						<!-- Project idea -->
							<article id="Projectidea">
								<h2 class="major">Project idea</h2>
								<p>The project that I will be discussing is a smartphone app project called “Parkey” that simply put allows users to determine parking at specific locations before they even leave their homes or while they are on route. It’s mainly used as a utility for convenience to allow consumers to save time and not stress about where they can leave their cars as it will be an app that constantly refreshes giving real time information about available car spots. The total goal is to have high traffic locations such as shopping centres on board to improve the apps effectiveness in congested areas. </p>
								<p> According to BBC news Australia, two in three Australians drive to and from work or use a car for their daily commute opposed to one in 10 Australians relying on public transport. To add to that statistic there are 13.3 million registered vehicles. the average shopping centre only has between 5000 -10,000 spaces. “Parkey” aims to make sure its users don’t waste time searching up and down the aisles of shopping centres waiting for a spot to pop up like a shark by clearly telling them what’s available and what isn’t. Northland shopping centre in Preston only claims to have 4800 spaces, while highpoint in Maribyrnong claims to have around 7000, when the average daily commute of drivers is upwards of 500,000 per day these figures are quite minor which makes parking harder than ever, and this is before sales events like boxing day is even considered. So, there is a demand for apps like Parkey to bring order to the mayhem. The scope of the app can be made broader however as a start up its use will be restricted to shopping centres.</p>
								<p>The Parkey apps main feature will be the ability to tell its users when and where there is available parking in real time on a pre-generated map of the car park using green and red as indicators for empty and full. This is done using two systems, using phone GPS location information that is constantly being transmitted from people’s devices to remember where their last location in a vehicle was. This technology already exists in the iPhone and google maps and other GPS navigation apps so it’s just a matter of using already existing software to fulfil the needs of the app. The other system is that most shopping centres in this day and age already have parking sensors and number plate scanners to tell shoppers which levels are full and which levels are not. Parkey can use that information and take it one step further so that the customer can check it before they leave their house. This means the customer will have a good idea at all times as the two systems are interdependent of one another, so if one system stops working the other can still deliver accurate information. Is Epping Plaza full but Westfield Plenty valley is not? check it on Parkey, is Doncaster undercover parking full and you don’t want get your newly washed car wet on a rainy day? Check it on Parkey. Parkey can be used in a myriad of situations and has endless possibilities when it comes to convenience. Another small feature is letting customers know how long a car has in that spot before they need to leave due to time restrictions. No more stalking shoppers as they leave the centre to steal their parking spots, Parkey can give estimates on when shoppers should be returning to their cars. The app will also send notifications when the customers time in the spot is about to finish so there is no extra charges caused by losing track of time. The app will have a pay feature called “Parkeypass” where if there is a fee for parking it is all done automatically through a top up system or transaction straight from the users account. With the participation of shopping centres, this means no more reaching out the window for tickets or much worse, finishing an exhausting day of shopping only to realise you have misplaced your ticket aka your only way to get out of the parking area.  Theft is a major problem in some areas so another inbuilt feature is if for some reason your car has unfortunately been stolen parkey will notify you of this if the phone GPS doesn’t match the last location of the cars as well as the parking sensors allowing you to rest assured your car is monitored, a useful feature especially if you work in shopping centres.</p>
								<p>The bulk of creating the app will be in its software. If we want to make the app reach the maximum amount of people as possible it should be available on both Apple and Android platforms which means the software code will need to be developed in both Objective-C and Java respectively. This would require programmers with skills in both these languages to create the app and ensure its doing everything it’s meant to do. this should not be hard to achieve as more and more people are learning to code and entering the I.T field so there should be an abundance of people with the right skills and experience available.  Since the app mostly piggybacks off of already existing technology, It’s the ability to use existing technology and systems, reverse engineering it and optimising it to achieve the apps goals where the development lies is key. Servers and back-up servers will have to be involved for storing data since everything is happening in real time, so some cloud computing and server maintenance will need to be used and a person ready to fix any issue that comes along. Of course, there has to be security measures as well, since people can choose to pay through the app so its another element to consider. There are plenty of security analysts and people with the right skills to achieve these tasks it should not be hard to find them for the development of the app. There is minimum hardware as the shopping centres already have systems to track vehicles but if they don’t they would have to be installed and programmed. The apps success will largely be determined by the people behind it and the willingness of shopping centres and other places to use the app to improve their business.</p>
								<p> The successful impact of this project is large in scale. If it can be implemented well in shopping centres it can be taken to anywhere with a parking bay.  The apps success means that no longer will people have to drive around causing more unnecessary traffic as they search anxiously for spots wasting valuable time and of course petrol looking for a park. Congestion rates in shopping centres will go down as no one is waiting to exit and stuck behind the person whose ticket won’t read properly in the terminal. No more road rage caused by frustrated shoppers fighting over the same spot. The paranoia of leaving your car somewhere you do not trust is minimised. The benefits are endless but most importantly, the success of this app will change the way we look at parking, changing it from stressful and frustrating, to a calming and convenient experience.</p>
